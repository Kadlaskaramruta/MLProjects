Heart Disease Analysis

This repository contains a small project focused on the analysis of heart disease based on a provided CSV dataset. The dataset consists of several columns, each providing different features related to individuals and their potential risk of heart disease. Below is a description of each column heading to aid in understanding the dataset:

Age: Age of the candidate.
Sex: Numeric values where 1 denotes male and 0 denotes female.
Chest Pain: Pain levels categorized from 0 to 3, representing different types of angina. Higher values indicate lower odds of a heart attack.
Resting Blood Pressure: Normal blood pressure measured with no exercise.
Cholesterol: Level of blockage for blood supply in the blood vessels.
Fasting Blood Pressure: Blood sugar level taken after a long gap between a meal and the test, typically measured in the morning before any meal.
Rest ECG: Electrocardiogram (ECG) values taken while the person is at rest, indicating normal functioning of the heart without exercise.
Maximum Heart Rate: The highest heart rate achieved.
Exercise Induced Angina: Presence of chest pain while exercising or doing any physical activity.
ST Depression: The difference between the value of ECG at rest and after exercise.
ST Slope: Tangent to the depression value.
Ca: Number of major blood vessels supplying blood to the heart that are blocked.
Thalassemia Types: Different types of thalassemia.
Heart Disease: Prediction of heart disease occurrence, where 1 denotes heart disease occurred and 0 denotes it didn't occur.
The project aims to analyze this dataset to understand the factors contributing to heart disease occurrence and potentially build predictive models to identify individuals at risk. The analysis may include exploratory data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques.
